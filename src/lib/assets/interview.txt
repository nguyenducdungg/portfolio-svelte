What inspired you to pursue front-end development, and could you share a bit about your journey to entering this field?

From a young age, I always had a passion for the arts. I grew up in a traditional household, where my parents encouraged
me to pursue a more traditional career path, such as engineering or law. However, I knew that my true calling was in the
 creative world, and I was drawn to art in all its forms. When I was younger, I dreamed of becoming a comic book artist,
 but I soon realized how difficult it was to make a living in that field.

It was then that I discovered front-end development. I saw how this field allowed me to combine my love of art and design
with the practical skills of coding and programming. I was inspired by the idea that I could use technology to bring
my creative visions to life, and I knew that front-end development was the perfect path for me.
